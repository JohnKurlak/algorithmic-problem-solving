## Chapter 1: Problem structure

Algorithmic interview problems tend to follow a particular format. Being familiar with this format is necessary for solving problems quickly and correctly.

Consider the following problem statement:

> You have a catalog of stars, with each star stored as an object of the following class:

>```
class Star {
    String name;
    int brightness;
    ...
}
```

> Write a method that accepts an array of ```n``` stars and an integer `k` and returns the `k` brightest stars.

### Identifying the goal of a problem

The first time you hear a problem statement, try to identify the basic goal of the problem. Do this by looking for verbs that command you to do something.  Common verbs in problem statements include:

* Find
* Determine
* Minimize/maximize
* Count
* Calculate
* Return
* Design

...and so on.

If you still don't understand what a question is asking after hearing it, ask your interviewer to clarify.

Once you know what the problem is asking, you will be better prepared to analyze the other components of the problem.

### Understanding the terminology

Now that you know what your goal is, it's time to break the problem down into its individual parts. To do that, you must first understand the terminology used in interview problems.

Many interview problems use specific terminology for:

* Variables and their ranges
* Run-time and space complexities
* Programming concepts

#### Variables and their Ranges

Interview problems use variables to specify quantities whose values are unknown until run-time. This means variables are handy for specifying inputs and outputs.

Generally, variables are expressed as a single lowercase or uppercase letter from either the English alphabet (e.g., a, b, c, ...) or the Greek alphabet (e.g., α, β, γ, ...).

In the example problem above, we have two variables: ```n``` and ```k```.

#### Run-time and Space Complexities



#### Programming concepts

There are a number of programming concepts that show up in interview problems. Knowing the meaning of these concepts will help you understand problems a lot better.

Here are the most common programming terms used in interview problems:

* subarray
* substring
* subsequence
* maximum
* minimum
* lexicographical
* permutation
* combination
* recursive
* iterative
* frequent
