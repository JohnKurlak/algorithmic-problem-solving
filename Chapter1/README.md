## Chapter 1: Problem structure

Algorithmic interview problems tend to follow a particular format. Being familiar with this format is necessary for solving problems quickly and correctly.

Consider the following problem statement:

> Suppose we are cataloging ```n``` stars. Each star has a brightness, ```b[i]```, where ```0 <= i < n```. Write a method that accepts an array of brightnesses (```b[0...n-1]```) and an integer `k` and returns the `k` brightest stars.
