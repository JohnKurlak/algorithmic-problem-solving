## Chapter 1: Problem structure

Algorithmic interview problems tend to follow a particular format. Being familiar with this format is necessary for solving problems quickly and correctly.

Consider the following problem statement:

> You have a catalog of stars, with each star stored as an object of the following class:

>```
class Star {
    String name;
    int brightness;
    ...
}
```

> Write a method that accepts an array of stars and an integer `k` and returns the `k` brightest stars.

The first time you hear a problem statement, try to identify the basic goal of the problem. In this case, the basic goal is to identify the brightest stars in some collection.
