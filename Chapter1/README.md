## Chapter 1: Problem structure

Algorithmic interview problems tend to follow a particular format. Being familiar with this format is necessary for solving problems quickly and correctly.

Consider the following problem statement:

> You have a catalog of stars, with each star stored as an object of the following class:

>```
class Star {
    String name;
    int brightness;
    ...
}
```

> Write a method that accepts an array of stars and an integer `k` and returns the `k` brightest stars.

The first time you hear a problem statement, try to identify the basic goal of the problem. In this case, the basic goal is to identify the brightest stars in some collection.

### Identifying the goal of a problem

To identify the basic goal of a problem, look for verbs that command you to do something.  Common verbs in problem statements include:

* Find
* Determine
* Minimize/maximize
* Count
* Calculate
* Return
* Design

...and so on.

If you still don't understand what the question is asking, ask your interviewer to clarify.

Once you know what the problem is asking, you will be better prepared to analyze the other components of the problem.

### Understanding the terminology

Now that you know what your goal is, it's time to break the problem down into its individual parts. To do that, you must understand the terminology used in interview problems.
