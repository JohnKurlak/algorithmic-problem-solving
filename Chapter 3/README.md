## Chapter 3: Working through examples

Now that you understand what the problem is asking and have challenged some of your initial assumptions, the next step is to work through an example or two.

Many times an interviewer will give you an example input and output for the problem. Talk your way through the example and make sure you understand how the input is being transformed into the output. If you are unsure, ask the interviewer to clarify.

Next, formulate your own example input and output. Many of the examples interviewers give are too simple. You want to come up with an example or two that push the limits of the problem. Try to come up with an example that covers as many scenarios as possible.

For example, suppose you are given a reference to a binary tree node and need to find the in-order successor of that node. Your example input will be a binary tree and a node. You example output will be the in-order successor of that node. For a problem like this, it is helpful to have a complicated binary search tree. Draw nodes that have 0 children, 1 child, and 2 children. Include sparse sections in your tree and full sections in your tree. Try finding the in-order successor of the smallest node, the largest node, and a selection of internal and leaf nodes.

As you ponder sample inputs and outputs, you will start coming up with ideas on how to solve the problem. You can't transform a sample input into the correct output without knowing how to solve the problem. Whatever you are doing to solve the problem in your head is probably close to the brute force solution, so this step is important.
