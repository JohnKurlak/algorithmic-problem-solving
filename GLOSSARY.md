# Glossary

## lexicographical
The natural order of characters in an alphabet.

For example, `"cat"` comes before `"train"` and after `"car"` lexicographically.

## maximum
The largest value in a collection.

For example, the largest value in `[1, 44, 39, 2, 39, 18]` is `44`.

## minimum
The smallest value in a collection.

For example, the smallest value in `[1, 44, 39, 2, 39, 18]` is `1`.

## permutation
An ordering of elements in a collection.

For example, the permutations of `"abcd"` are:

```java
"abcd"
"abdc"
"acbd"
"acdb"
"adbc"
"adcb"
"bacd"
"badc"
"bcad"
"bcda"
"bdac"
"bdca"
"cabd"
"cadb"
"cbad"
"cbda"
"cdab"
"cdba"
"dabc"
"dacb"
"dbac"
"dbca"
"dcab"
"dcba"
```

## subarray
A slice of contiguous elements in an array.

For example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` has the following subarrays:

```java
[]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[1, 2]
[2, 3]
[3, 4]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## subsequence
A selection of contiguous or non-contiguous elements/characters from an array/string, in order from left to right.

For example, the string `"abcd"` has the following subsequences:

```java
""
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d"
"ab"
"ac"
"ad"
"bc"
"bd"
"cd"
"abc"
"abd"
"acd"
"bcd"
"abcd"
```

## substring
A slice of contiguous characters in a string.

For example, the string `"abcd"` has the following substrings:

```java
""
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d"
"ab"
"bc"
"cd"
"abc"
"bcd"
"abcd"
```
