## subarray
A slice of contiguous elements in an array.

For example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` has the following subarrays:

```java
[]
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[1, 2]
[2, 3]
[3, 4]
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## subsequence
A selection of contiguous or non-contiguous elements/characters from an array/string, in order from left to right.

For example, the string `"abcd"` has the following subsequences:

```java
""
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d"
"ab"
"ac"
"ad"
"bc"
"bd"
"cd"
"abc"
"abd"
"acd"
"bcd"
"abcd"
```

For example, the string `"abcd"` has the following substrings:

```java
""
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d"
"ab"

"cd"
"abc"
"bcd"
